I had some trouble on github trying to push my latest version of the code to my original repo. 
I still have the other repo public for storing the previous versions of the code.


I didn't see the part of the assignment where I needed to regularly upload to github so I am starting not. 
Up to this point I developed funtions for all of the options on the to-do list application, except for the 'mark complete' option. 
I got stuck there for a bit. I looked up the issues I was having and got myself to understand what I believe will help me accomplish this goal. 
The first commit for this code will be from my second day (today) after I started working on the funtionality for having an option to mark tasks complete.

My lateset work has been adding the delete_task function and getting that working. Now I believe it is complete.
